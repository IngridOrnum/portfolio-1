### Installing
* [User pages (deployed on Vercel)](https://project-exam-1-blog.vercel.app/user/index.html)
* [Admin pages (deployed on Vercel)](https://project-exam-1-blog.vercel.app/admin/account/login.html)

### Description
The Nordic Trekking Blog Interface is a front-end user interface for an API-driven blogging application focused on hiking and outdoor activities in Norway. The application allows users to explore various hiking, skiing, and biking trips with detailed recommendations and beautiful imagery. This project also provides an admin interface for content management where blogs can be created, deleted or edited.

This project was a project exam while studying on Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

#### What was the assignment?
The assignment for the FED1 Project Exam 1 was to design, build, and test a responsive web application that serves as a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application. This involved planning the project, designing a user interface, and using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement mandatory features. Some of these were a blog feed page with an interactive carousel, a public blog post page and admin pages for blog management. Frameworks like CSS or JS Frameworks were not allowed.

#### Tools and technology
* Figma: For designing wireframes and high-fidelity assets.
* Sourcetree: Git version control was managed using Sourcetree.
* Webp Converter: I downloaded and used this tool to compress images to under 200kb, from jpeg to webp.
* FontAwesome: For incorporating icons into the interface.
* Google Fonts: For typography and enhancing the visual appeal.
* ChatGPT: Used for debugging and assistance during development.
* Notion: I used Notion, a web application for taking notes.

#### Challenges and learning points
1. API Integration: This was my first experience with API-based login and registration, and handling access tokens. Initially, this was a challenging concept, but I now have a much better understanding.
2. Content Structuring: The provided API had limitations, such as a single string for the body content and only one image per post. To address this, I used ChatGPT to help split the body content into multiple paragraphs and include additional images.
3. Design Adjustments: I had to adjust my initial design to align better with the API's capabilities, simplifying some aspects to streamline development.
4. New Design Techniques: Implementing a parallax effect for the background image on the user landing page was a new experience, and I learned a lot from incorporating this effect.

GitHub Repo: [Project Repo](https://github.com/IngridOrnum/semester-project-2023)

### Description
This webpage serves as the online presence for the fictional "Community Science Museum". The project aims to engage visitors by promoting upcoming events and providing previews of current exhibitions. Users can find essential information such as the museum's location, opening hours, contact details, and admission fees. The website features playful colours designed to intrigue the target audience - children (7-15 yrs).

This project was the first semester project while studying front-end development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

#### What was the assignment?
The assignment for Semester Project 1 involves creating a website for the Community Science Museum designed to attract middle school pupils and their families. The purpose of the project was to develop a responsive, informative and appealing website for the Community Science Museum with the target group in mind.

#### Tools and technology
* Figma: For designing wireframes and high-fidelity assets.
* Sourcetree: Git version control was managed using Sourcetree.
* Webp Converter: I downloaded and used this tool to compress images to under 200kb, from jpeg to webp.
* FontAwesome: For incorporating icons into the interface.
* Google Fonts: For typography and enhancing the visual appeal.
* ChatGPT: Used for debugging and assistance during development.
* Flaticon: Some icons used on the page is from Flaticon.
* Notion: I used Notion, a web application for taking notes.

#### Challenges and learning points
I had some difficulty deciding on design. I had many ideas regarding the design, but was split between a minimalistic og a more maximalistic design. I ended up with a design with more colours and childlike design with the target audience in mind, which were children.

I also had some trouble with the work process related to branches in SourceTree, because I by mistake merged some of the branches before being completely done with the issue. This resulted in what can look like a messy workflow. As a result of this I learned that I must make even more detailed issues on the GitHub board for each page.
