The Nordic Trekking Blog Interface is a front-end user interface for an API-driven blogging application focused on hiking and outdoor activities in Norway. The application allows users to explore various hiking, skiing, and biking trips with detailed recommendations and beautiful imagery. This project also provides an admin interface for content management where blogs can be created, deleted or edited.

This project was a project exam while studying on Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.
